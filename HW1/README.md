### Vehicle Management System

#### Homework 1

This console program simulates a simple management system that might exist at a car  
rental company. The program allows a user to add different types of vehicles (car, truck, or motorcycle)  
as well as customizing the attributes of them. The three types are derived from a generic Vehicle  
class allowing for polymorphic behaviour and allows easier storing within the same datastructure.  
Lastly, the program allows the user to move created vehicles between two datastructures which  
signify a list of already rented vehicles and ones which are available for rental.

To run the console program, simply clone the repository and open visual studio 2022  
with the Visual Studio solution file `~/../HW1/HW1.sln`. This will open the project with c++20  
already chosen as the standard.

Use `ctrl + F5` and the program will run.
